# COVER - BackEnd

## Introduction

The backend of the project manages all user functions displayed in the frontend. User login details are stored in the backend database, which verifies this information for login and provides access to the home page. The home page displays user's registered device information, retrieved from the database. Operations on registered devices are automatically saved back to the database. New device registrations involve storing protocol information, operational options, and control methods, including control signals.

## Technologies and Languages

This project is built with Node.js, Express, and MySQL.
